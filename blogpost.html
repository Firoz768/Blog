            After a newspaper article appeared about my first published book and I received an invitation from a local school to speak to kids about literacy,  I realized that I would have to transition from the proverbial shy writer to charismatic speaker. 

No pressure. 

From the guy that was comfortable in the shadows to someone who would eventually speak at writer’s conferences, schools, and libraries throughout the US, no one would have ever told me the transition would come as easily as it did. 

This was to be a huge accomplishment for someone who suffered from stage fright. Face it, we started writing because we loved the challenge of bringing words together and creating our own worlds. The excitement furthered when we could share that masterpiece with readers and get response and reviews when our work became published. Of course, there was a major bridge between sitting alone in our room/office/closet/back porch and slapping words together and standing alone in front of middle schoolers, other writers, or hopeful writers and convincing them that you are an authority on the subject. The method and journey to get there is what I would like to share.

That first author visit at a local school taught me something. It wasn’t something learned from an article, or radio show, or even at a conference, it was something the teacher told me in passing. She had no idea that it would be the inspiration to make that first talk a total success.

She told me, “They want you to be here, you’re keeping them from schoolwork, just make it fun and sprinkle in some memorable facts they will take home.”

I did. And they have invited me back every year since. And teachers love to share with other teachers and school librarians from other schools in the community – it was free advertisement. Graduating to writer’s conferences was the next step and this is something that the new writer would never fathom. But guess what? When they are seeking proposals for authors to speak in panels or workshops on writing, you totally qualify for that panel or presentation. Yes, that’s right, you have an in. You are a professional on the subject. After all, you are a writer.

What’s your expertise, you ask? The first time I realized I had something I could share with writers was when I went to a book fair. Several local authors were chosen to bring and sell their works. I thought “Wow this will be cool.” I set up six of my titles on the table and every time a parent and child approached my table, I’d hear, “Mom I want that book!” They pointed excitedly at the same book each time: my middle grade paranormal adventure, “Who Is The Gray Man?” I had six titles on that table, but the kids flocked to that one. They wanted the book without even knowing what it was about. Why? Remember that old adage “A book is judged by its cover”? 

Being creative is part of the writing process, that whole part where you come up with an idea and it turns into multiple pages of word-building and a plot and storyline and characters is what drives all of us. But book covers are my passion. Before writing took over my brain, I was an artist. In my youth I swore I’d work for Stan Lee and become the next Jack Kirby. 

Well at that book fair, that cover just jumped out at the kids. It wasn’t until that day that I took notice of the power of the cover. Soon after I wrote an article about it that was published online by C. Hope Clark’s Funds For Writer’s newsletter. That became my first paid article. I was on a roll. Then I decided to try and make a Powerpoint presentation from that article. I figured at least at some point I may be asked to speak on it and I’d be ready. The offers didn’t come knocking on the door. As is usual with us writers, if you want it,you have to go for it. I submitted it for a writer’s workshop, and it was accepted. Next thing I knew I was on a plane to Ohio to give a workshop on book covers to a classroom full of indie authors who wanted some pointers.

I made book covers a passion, something I would get questions and asked advice on. In the viewpoint of the person asking, I was an expert. I honed on it and decided to reach out to other writer’s conferences. I’ve been giving this workshop (as well as others) ever since. I was even asked to give a keynote.

What’s your expertise? Have you had to take care of your elderly parent with dementia ? Homeschool your kids? Make goodies for your daughter’s softball team? Coach your daughter’s softball team? Do your own oil change? Guess what? You are an expert. You have advice you can give to someone who has no idea how to approach the subject. What was your journey to get you there? How much study, practice, research, trial and error did it get you to finally walk through it with your eyes closed? There are people who need that advice, and you are the person they need to hear it from.

How do you go from desk to stage? Just like with writing, it takes practice. The next time you are at a writer’s conference and sitting in that workshop, watch the speaker. Are they funny? Serious? Technical? You can be that person. Emulate style, form, and delivery and always add humor. Remember, they want you to be there. You have something they want to hear, something they want to walk away from and say, “Man I never thought of that.” Visit a local chapter of Toastmasters in your area, you will learn a lot about delivery, speech and the pitfalls we all suffer in the beginning. Then you can be up there at the podium – sharing your expertise for all of us to learn from.

Author of middle grade & young adult, Rod Martinez grew up on Marvel Comics and Twilight Zone, the inspiration was inevitable. Challenged by his son to write a story about him and his friends “like the Goonies’ but in Tampa”, that challenge became his first published novel – and the rest– is history. Rod was the recipient of the 2017 Jerry Spinelli Scholarship, the 2018 Professional Development for Artists Grant in Tampa and several WOC scholarships/awards. A self-proclaimed Ambassador of the Literary Arts, he speaks at schools, conferences, comic-cons and libraries promoting the love of the written word.
